# Source-of-Truth (SoT) Library

This directory holds the durable, ID-based specifications that make up the knowledge graph for your product.

<!-- SECTION: sot-registry -->
## Structure

Each file focuses on one artifact type with a consistent ID prefix (~100-150 lines each):

| File | ID Prefix | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `SoT.UNIQUE_ID_SYSTEM.md` | (governance) | ID format, prefixes, and registry |
| `SoT.BUSINESS_RULES.md` | BR-XXX | Business constraints and rules |
| `SoT.USER_JOURNEYS.md` | UJ, PER, SCR | User journeys, personas, screens |
| `SoT.API_CONTRACTS.md` | API-XXX | API endpoint specifications |
| `SoT.DATA_MODEL.md` | DBT-XXX | Database tables and schema |
| `SoT.TESTING.md` | TEST-XXX | Test cases and coverage |
| `SoT.DEPLOYMENT.md` | DEP, RUN, MON, SEC | Deployment, runbooks, monitoring, secrets |
| `SoT.customer_feedback.md` | CFD-XXX | Customer feedback and insights |
| `SoT.DESIGN_COMPONENTS.md` | DES-XXX | UI components and design tokens |
| `SoT.TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md` | TECH, ARC, ENV | Tech stack, architecture, environment |
| `SoT.INTEGRATIONS.md` | INT-XXX | Third-party service integrations |
| `SoT.LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | LL-XXX | Cross-session behavioral feedback |

**IDs in PRD/README** (not SoT files): FEA-XXX, RISK-XXX, GTM-XXX, KPI-XXX
<!-- /SECTION: sot-registry -->

> See [SoT.UNIQUE_ID_SYSTEM.md](SoT.UNIQUE_ID_SYSTEM.md) for full ID specifications.

> **The as-built layer (v0.7)**: the IDs in these files are the *spec* layer of the knowledge graph. During build execution the product's code becomes a second layer, bridged back to these IDs via the `@implements` tags in code (see `.claude/rules/04-coding-standards.md`). The devgraph emitter is not yet adopted in this repo; the schema it would follow is [`../docs/DEVELOPMENT_GRAPH.md`](../docs/DEVELOPMENT_GRAPH.md).

## How to Initialize

1. Fork this repository for your product
2. Populate each `SoT.*.md` file with entries specific to your product
3. Each entry gets a unique ID (metadata, description, references)
4. Cross-link IDs from PRD, README, EPICs, and other SoT files

## Maintenance Rules

- **Never delete IDs** — mark as deprecated and link to replacement
- **Update timestamps** — change `Last Updated` when entry changes
- **Add via EPICs** — new IDs should be tracked in the EPIC **Context & IDs** section
- **Keep files lean** — target 80-120 lines per SoT file

## Template Contract

All SoT files follow this structure:

```
1. YAML Frontmatter (10-15 lines)
2. Title + Purpose Block (5-10 lines)
3. Navigation by Category (10-20 lines)
4. ONE Example Entry (30-50 lines)
5. Deprecated Section (5-10 lines)
6. Cross-Reference Index (10-15 lines)
7. Update Protocol (15-20 lines)
```
